/*
	In this example, we have the DerivedClass that derives from
	the BaseClass. Both classes have a print function.

	The idea is to have a function, callPrint, that is NOT a
	member function and call the print function of the parent
	class and any derived class.

	If you create a function callPrint that passes an
	object of the BaseClass, as in this case, you will not
	get the expected output.
